<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<hr

<h2>A place I'd like to visit</h2>
<p> If I could go anywhere in the world, I would go to Giant's Causeway in Ireland because I think it's the magical place
    in the world. The architecture of the rocks is so natural and yet so unnatural. The hexagonal shapes are unlike
    anything I've ever experienced first-hand. I have seen honeycombs before, but those are made generally quickly and uniformly,
    whereas rocks are rarely ever uniform and almost never in that size. In general, I just want to visit the most magical places</p>
<h2>A person I admire (past or present)</h2>
<p>A person that I admire right now is Lady Gaga. I remember growing up and seeing her be so uninhibited and the negative attention
she got from so many people. I fed into that and truly though that she was a weirdo and wasn't even good at singing. I've been realizing
recently that she is someone who has been true to herself since the beginning. I fear so often of being disliked or being negatively talked
about like that. Because of that fear I feel as though I am not being true to who I am. She makes me feel good to be myself.</p>
